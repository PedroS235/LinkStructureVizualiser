# LinkStructureVizualiser

This is my Bachelor Semester project-1 (BSP-1) wich is called Link Structure Vizualiser

Link Structure Vizualiser is a program that extract all the links from a URL and then represents the different liks in a graphical interface. The extractor does not only extract the links from the main webpage, but all the links from within the links of the main webpage. This means that it extracts first all of the links from the main webpage and then it goes and extracts all the links from the existing links. The final result will be a graph where all these differnt links will be represented in a form of a data structure graph.
